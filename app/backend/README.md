## Running the Backend

To run the backend, navigate to the [``app/backend``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fazureuser%2Fazure-search-openai-demo%2Fapp%2Fbackend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\azureuser\azure-search-openai-demo\app\backend") directory and use the following command:

```sh
python main.py
```

Please ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed in your environment. You can install them using the [``requirements-dev.txt``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fazureuser%2Fazure-search-openai-demo%2Frequirements-dev.txt%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\azureuser\azure-search-openai-demo\requirements-dev.txt") file at the root of the project:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Testing

Unit tests for the backend can be run using pytest. From the root of the project, use the following command:

```sh
python -m pytest
```

End-to-end tests can also be run with pytest:

```sh
python -m pytest tests/e2e.py --tracing=retain-on-failure
```

## Contributing

Contributions to the backend are welcome. Please follow the guidelines outlined in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22CONTRIBUTING.md%22%2C%22CONTRIBUTING.md%22%5D "CONTRIBUTING.md") file at the root of the project.
